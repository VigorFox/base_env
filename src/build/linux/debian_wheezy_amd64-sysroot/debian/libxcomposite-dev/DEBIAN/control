Description: X11 Composite extension library (development headers)
 libXcomposite provides an X Window System client interface to the Composite
 extension to the X protocol.
 .
 The Composite extension allows clients called compositing managers to control
 the final drawing of the screen.  Rendering is done into an off-screen buffer.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libxcomposite1.  Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
