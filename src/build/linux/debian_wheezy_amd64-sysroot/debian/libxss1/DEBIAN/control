Description: X11 Screen Saver extension library
 libXss provides an X Window System client interface to the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER
 extension to the X protocol.

 The Screen Saver extension allows clients behaving as screen savers to
 register themselves with the X server, to better integrate themselves with
 the running session.
