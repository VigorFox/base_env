Description: Common interface to speech synthesizers
 Speech Dispatcher provides a device independent layer for speech synthesis.
 It supports various software and hardware speech synthesizers as
 backends and provides a generic layer for synthesizing speech and
 playing back PCM data via those different backends to applications.
 .
 Various high level concepts like enqueueing vs. interrupting speech and
 application specific user configurations are implemented in a device
 independent way, therefore freeing the application programmer from
 having to yet again reinvent the wheel.
 .
 This package contains Speech Dispatcher itself.
