Description: X11 Screen Saver extension library (development headers)
 libXss provides an X Window System client interface to the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER
 extension to the X protocol.
 .
 The Screen Saver extension allows clients behaving as screen savers to
 register themselves with the X server, to better integrate themselves with
 the running session.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libxss1.  Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
