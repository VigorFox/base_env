Description: Userspace interface to radeon-specific kernel DRM services -- runtime
 This library implements the userspace interface to the radeon-specific kernel
 DRM services.  DRM stands for "Direct Rendering Manager", which is the
 kernelspace portion of the "Direct Rendering Infrastructure" (DRI). The DRI is
 currently used on Linux to provide hardware-accelerated OpenGL drivers.
