Description: simple interprocess messaging system (GLib-based shared library)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides the GLib-based shared library for applications using the
 GLib interface to D-Bus.
 .
 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.
