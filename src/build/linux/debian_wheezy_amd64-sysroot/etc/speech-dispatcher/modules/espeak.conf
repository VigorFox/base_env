# Espeak  does not currently support playing sound icons
# (audio files that are played by name when an application requests
# a sound icon).  If you have installed the free(b)soft sound-icons
# package, this is the directory where will they be found.  If not
# blank, the espeak Output Module will play them if it finds a
# file whose name matches the sound icon name.  If blank, or no
# matching file is found, the name of the sound icon will be spoken.
