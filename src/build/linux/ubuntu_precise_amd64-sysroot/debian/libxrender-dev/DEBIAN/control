Description: X Rendering Extension client library (development files)
 The X Rendering Extension (Render) introduces digital image composition as
 the foundation of a new rendering model within the X Window System.
 Rendering geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation into
 either triangles or trapezoids.  Text is drawn by loading glyphs into the
 server and rendering sets of them.  The Xrender library exposes this
 extension to X clients.
 .
 This package provides a static library and C header files.
