Description: Pluggable Authentication Modules library
 Contains the shared library for Linux-PAM, a library that enables the
 local system administrator to choose how applications authenticate users.
 In other words, without rewriting or recompiling a PAM-aware application,
 it is possible to switch between the authentication mechanism(s) it uses.
 One may entirely upgrade the local authentication system without touching
 the applications themselves.
