Description: GNOME configuration database system (dummy package)
 GConf is a configuration database system for storing application
 preferences. It supports default or mandatory settings set by the
 administrator, and changes to the database are instantly applied to all
 running applications. It is written for the GNOME desktop but doesn't
 require it.
 .
 This package is here to ensure smooth upgrades. It can be removed when
 you see fit.
