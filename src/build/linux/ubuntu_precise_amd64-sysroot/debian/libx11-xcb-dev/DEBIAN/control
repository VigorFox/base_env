Description: Xlib/XCB interface library (development headers)
 libX11-xcb provides functions needed by clients which take advantage of
 Xlib/XCB to mix calls to both Xlib and XCB over the same X connection.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libx11-xcb1. Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
