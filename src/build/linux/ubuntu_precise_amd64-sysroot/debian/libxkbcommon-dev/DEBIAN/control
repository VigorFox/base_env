Description: library interface to the XKB compiler - development files
 libxkbcommon aims at replacing xkbcomp, the XKB compiler.
 .
 UNSUPPORTED.  This is an experimental library, and its ABI/API is likely to change
 on a regular fashion before it stabilizes, depending on XServer's and
 Wayland's needs in particular.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libxkbcommon0. Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
