Description: wayland compositor infrastructure - shared libraries
 Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well
 as a C library implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be
 a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and
 evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland client
 itself. The clients can be traditional applications, X servers
 (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers.
 .
 This is an experimental library package, neither ABI or API are fixed
 right now. As a consequence, generated dependencies are made as
 strict as possible. It should only be used by mesa and wayland-demos.
